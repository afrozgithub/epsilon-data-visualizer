Test Cases for the website visualization:

1) Verify that the number of nodes in the hive plot equals to the number of packages defined in the JSON
   
  Steps:
	1. Count the total number of JSON objects in the JSON file
	2. Count the total number of distinct coloured nodes in the hive plot 
   
  Expected Result:
	1. Total number of JSON objects in the JSON file == Total number of distinct coloured nodes in the hive plot

  Actual Result:
	1. Twice as many nodes are being shown, 2 nodes for each package. [FAIL]

  Bug report: Issue #15 


2) Verify that the node links reflect the dependencies as defined in the JSON
  
  Steps:
	1. Compare the links between nodes with the dependencies defined in the JSON
   
  Expected Result:
	1. The links in the hive plot correspond to the defined dependencies in the JSON

  Actual Result:
	1. Same as expected [PASS]


3) Default text displays in the top left corner describing hive plot
  
  Steps:
	1. Open web browser to site.html
   
  Expected Result:
	1. Top left text displays: ���Showing {} dependencies among {} packages���

  Actual Result:
	1. Same as expected [PASS]


4) Default text shows package name when a node is moused over
  
  Steps:
	1. Mouseover a node
   
  Expected Result:
	1. Top left text ���Showing {} dependencies among {} packages��� changes to the node���s package name

  Actual Result:
	1. Same as expected [PASS]


5) Default text shows package dependencies when a link is moused over
  
  Steps:
	1. Mouseover a link
   
  Expected Result:
	1. Top left text ���Showing {#} dependencies among {#} packages��� changes to ���{package _} DEPENDS ON {package _}���

  Actual Result:
	1. Same as expected [PASS]
