Test Cases for the website visualization:

1) Verify that the number of nodes in the hive plot equals to the number of packages defined in the JSON
   
  Steps:
	1. Count the total number of JSON objects in the JSON file
	2. Count the total number of distinct coloured nodes in the hive plot 
   
  Expected Result:
	1. Total number of JSON objects in the JSON file == Total number of distinct coloured nodes in the hive plot

  Actual Result:
	1. Twice as many nodes are being shown, 2 nodes for each package. [FAIL]

  Bug report: Resolved in Issue #15 


2) Verify that the node links reflect the dependencies as defined in the JSON
  
  Steps:
	1. Compare the links between nodes with the dependencies defined in the JSON
   
  Expected Result:
	1. The links in the hive plot correspond to the defined dependencies in the JSON

  Actual Result:
	1. Same as expected [PASS]


3) Default text displays in the top left corner describing hive plot
  
  Steps:
	1. Open web browser to site.html
   
  Expected Result:
	1. Top left text displays: ���Showing {} dependencies among {} packages���

  Actual Result:
	1. Same as expected [PASS]


4) Default text shows package name when a node is moused over
  
  Steps:
	1. Mouseover a node
   
  Expected Result:
	1. Top left text ���Showing {} dependencies among {} packages��� changes to the node���s package name

  Actual Result:
	1. Same as expected [PASS]


5) Default text shows package dependencies when a link is moused over
  
  Steps:
	1. Mouseover a link
   
  Expected Result:
	1. Top left text ���Showing {#} dependencies among {#} packages��� changes to ���{package _} DEPENDS ON {package _}���

  Actual Result:
	1. Same as expected [PASS]
	

6) Violation sidebar info still visible after node mouse over
  
  Steps:
	1. Mouse over a node with violations
	2. Mouse out 
	3. Mouse over a node with no violations
   
  Expected Result:
	1. Violation info appears on right sidebar
	2. Violation info removed from right sidebar
	3. No violation data is shown

  Actual Result:
	1. Violation info appears on right sidebar 
	2. Violation info remains on right sidebar [FAIL]
	3. Violation info remains on right sidebar [FAIL]
 
  Bug Report: Resolved in Issue #20
  
  
 7) Violation correctly displayed for a node in hive plot
 
  Steps:
  	1. Mouse over a node 
  	2. Compare violation name to JSON data for that package
  	
  Expected Result:
	1. Violation name in JSON data == Violation name in hive plot
	
  Actual Result:
	1. Same as expected [PASS]
	

 8) Violations light up periodically
 
  Steps:
  	1. Open visualization
  	2. Wait 1000 ms
  	3. Wait 1000 ms
  	4. Wait 1000 ms
   
  Expected Result:
  	2. Node colour changes to violation colour
  	3. Node colour changes back to normal colour
  	4. Node colour changes to violation colour

  Actual Result:
  	Same as expected [PASS]
